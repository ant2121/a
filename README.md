# Hello, I'm Antone Currie


I’m a self-taught cybersecurity analyst at the start of my professional journey, actively seeking hands-on experience and opportunities to deepen my skills and grow in the field.

## Objective

My objective to become a cybersecurity analyst began with my fascination for the challenges and puzzle-like nature of the role, where problem-solving and critical thinking are essential every day. Hearing about how analysts investigate threats, analyze vulnerabilities, and protect systems sparked my curiosity and pushed me to learn more. I have always had a strong interest in technology, which naturally led me toward exploring cybersecurity in greater depth. As I continue developing my skills, I am motivated by the constant learning, evolving threats, and the opportunity to make a real impact in the tech world with hopes of doing so in the role of a cybersecurity anaylist. My curiosity for how systems work allows me to analyze vulnerabilities effectively and adapt to evolving security challenges. By staying committed to developing my skills and following best security practices, I aim to help organizations protect their data, systems, and operations.
